<p>My Little Pony: The Movie is a 2017 animated musical fantasy film based on the animated television series My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic, which was developed as part of the 2010 relaunch of the My Little Pony franchise by Hasbro. Directed by Jayson Thiessen from a story and screenplay by Meghan McCarthy (both Friendship Is Magic veterans), the plot follows the alicorn Twilight Sparkle, her five pony friends – collectively known as the "Mane 6" – and her dragon friend Spike embarking on a quest to save their home of Equestria from an evil conqueror while gaining new friends in the process. In addition to the show's regular voice cast reprising their roles, the film features the voices of Emily Blunt, Kristin Chenoweth, Liev Schreiber, Michael Peña, Sia, Taye Diggs, Uzo Aduba, and Zoe Saldana as new characters.</p>

<p>The film was produced by Allspark Pictures and DHX Media,[6][7] using traditional animation created with Toon Boom Harmony.[8] It premiered in New York City on September 24, 2017,[1] and was released on October 6, 2017 in North America by Lionsgate,[2] and in Canada by Entertainment One Films. The film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed over $61 million worldwide against a $6.5 million budget.</p>
<p>The ponies of Equestria prepare for their first Friendship Festival, overseen by Princess Twilight Sparkle in Canterlot. The festivities are interrupted by an invasion of monsters commanded by the unicorn Tempest Shadow, who is under orders from the Storm King to capture Equestria's princesses for him to harness their magic in exchange for restoring her broken horn. Twilight escapes being petrified by Tempest's magical orbs after Princess Celestia gives Princess Luna incomplete instructions to seek help from "the queen of the hippo" beyond Equestria. Joined by her friends Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, Rarity, Applejack, Fluttershy, and Spike, Twilight sets out to find the "hippos".</p>

<p>Twilight's group travel to the desert city of Klugetown, where a feline con artist named Capper offers to escort them, secretly intending to sell them to settle a debt. As Capper begins to develop a genuine friendship with them, Twilight discovers an atlas that reveals the "hippos" to be hippogriffs, exposing Capper's treachery. When Tempest arrives in pursuit of Twilight, the group evades her aboard a delivery airship run by birdlike pirates, whom Rainbow Dash persuades to take them to the hippogriffs' kingdom on Mount Aris. In a moment of over-excitement, Rainbow Dash performs a Sonic Rainboom that inadvertently gives their location away to Tempest, forcing the group to reach Mount Aris in a makeshift hot air balloon.</p>

<p>While exploring the hippogriffs' deserted kingdom, the ponies are saved from drowning in an underwater cavern by the seapony Princess Skystar, who leads them to her undersea home of Seaquestria. Skystar reveals her kind to be the hippogriffs, transformed by a magic pearl used by her mother, Queen Novo, to hide from the Storm King. When Novo denies them the pearl to use against the Storm King, Twilight desperately attempts to steal it while letting her friends unknowingly distract the sea ponies. Her plan backfires when she triggers an alarm before Pinkie can persuade Novo to give them the pearl, resulting in the entire group getting banished to the surface. After being abandoned by her friends over this, Twilight is kidnapped by Tempest, who gains her sympathy upon revealing how the loss of her horn as a filly after an Ursa minor attack destabilized her magic and caused her own friends to shun her. Meanwhile, Spike alerts the ponies to Twilight's capture, and they return to Canterlot to rescue her with the help of Capper, the pirates, and Skystar.</p>

<p>In Canterlot, Tempest delivers Twilight to the Storm King, who absorbs the princesses' magic to empower his mystical Staff of Sacanas and conjure a powerful storm against Twilight's friends, betraying Tempest as well. Twilight saves Tempest and reconciles with her friends, who help her take the staff and end the storm. The Storm King hurls a magical orb at the group to petrify them, but Tempest jumps in his way, turning them both into stone; the Storm King's body falls and shatters, while the group uses the staff to revive Tempest, who returns the stolen magic to restore the princesses and the damaged city. The Friendship Festival resumes, and the ponies celebrate with all of the allies Twilight's group have made on their adventure. Encouraged by Twilight, Tempest joins in by producing a fireworks display with her broken horn, and happily accepts the group's friendship.</p>
