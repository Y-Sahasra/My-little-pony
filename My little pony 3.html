<h1>Princess Luna</h1>
<p>Princess Luna is a dark-blue alicorn and Princess Celestia's younger sister. She serves as co-ruler of Equestria alongside Celestia, using her magic to raise the moon and safeguard her subjects' dreams during nighttime. A thousand years ago, Luna became bitter of everypony playing in the day, while they sleep through the night and ignore her. Luna's bitterness transformed herself into Nightmare Moon and she attempted to create eternal night all over Equestria. Celestia reluctantly used the Elements of Harmony to banish her to the moon, and took responsibility for raising both the sun and the moon and maintaining harmony in Equestria. Nightmare Moon first appears in season one's two-part premiere "Friendship Is Magic" when she escapes from the moon and attempts to carry out her plan. Twilight and her friends use the Elements of Harmony to defeat Nightmare Moon and turn her back into Luna, who reconciles with her sister and resumes her royal duties. During season nine, Celestia and Luna start preparing to retire from ruling Equestria and for Twilight to take their place. At the end of the show, after Twilight was crowned the new ruler of Equestria, Celestia and Luna retired to Silver Shoals.

Several episodes depict Luna's "difficulty living in her older sister's shadow", such as adapting to modern Equestrian customs and repairing her public image.</p>
